# Music-Player-Console-Application-in-C++-
An application to organize and play musical tracks along with corresponding artworks using **OOP** concepts and **Win32 API (Windows Multimedia).**

This project has been developed in response to my first introduction to Object Oriented Programming course.The basic concept that has been implemented is just out of my curiousity and interest.I didn't have any knowledge of GUI by then so I did it in console.
